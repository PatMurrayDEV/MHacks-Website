        <p>MHacks is all about making everyone feel welcome, and a part of that is making sure they can learn what they want to learn so they can build what they want to build. If you don't feel like an expert or don't feel like you know enough languages or frameworks or skills, that's completely okay. Even something small can change a hacker's entire experience.</p>
