        <p>When you’re ready, hit the apply button and fill out an application. Our decisions are released on a weekly basis, so if you submit an application by Friday at 11:59pm, you will receive a decision on Monday.</p>
        <p>If you submit an application after Friday at 11:59pm, your application will be read in the next cycle.</p>
        <p>If you need to change your answers, don’t worry! Just make sure you submit your changes before Friday 11:59pm of that week.</p>
        <p>Make sure you submit an application by September 9th in order to be considered for a travel reimbursement!</p>
